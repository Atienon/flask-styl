# flask-styl
An implementation of the STYL script with Flask

This is based on another repository of mine. The concept is you input the title of one song and get a list of ten recommendations based on that one song.

Setup:

You need to create a .env file with your CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET from Spotify. An extra SECRET_KEY is required so a CRSF token can be generated for the form.
